When the dream you’ve worked so hard for is right in front of you, yet somehow still out of reach?</p><h2 id=the-next-race>The next race?</h2><p>As I neared the end of my undergraduate studies, I began to feel the weight of deciding “the next move.” If you know me personally or have read my previous nUance article, you’d probably know that I’ve been working toward becoming a motorsport engineer. That dream shaped my years here in Nagoya—pulling myself through meetings, language barriers, and endless late nights. I prayed, put in the effort, and shot my shot at my dream university in the UK. All that was left was to wait for the start of my next race, wherever that may be.</p><p>I just wanted a clearer vision on how I will be moving on after I graduate, so when I finally got my admission results, it felt like a huge burden was taken off my back. I couldn’t believe it—<em>I passed</em>! I was overjoyed, thinking all those years of effort had finally paid off. My mind was eager to play through the memories of tomorrow.</p><p>Or so I wished&mldr; <em>I couldn’t fund myself</em>.</p><p>I didn’t get the scholarship. I didn’t have even 5% of the money to support just 1 year of studies. I wasn’t even eligible for a loan because of my nationality. I tried to find sponsors, hoping anyone would be willing to support a young Filipino guy onto the technical side of motorsport. It was final: I couldn’t go. The light didn’t turn green. I found myself bawling my eyes out as I stared at the screen right in front of me.</p><p>As I pressed that button. I grieved a future that might never be. It was painful as burying your favorite cat—it stung, but you had to see it to the end. All I had in mind was “<em>Why???</em>”</p><p>I told myself I had a plan: to go home. I was late for job hunting, so at least for the near future, I buried my dreams of working in R&amp;D in the automotive industry. I jokingly told my friends, “I’m going home” thinking that was the end of the road.</p><h2 id=one-last-ride-why-not>One last ride: why not?</h2><p>Back in March, I got invited to a Christian summer conference in Korea. The theme was “<em>Seize your Season</em>”, something I thought was so timely.</p><p>There were many reasons for me not to go: I had to finish my research, and I’d likely have to pay out of pocket. Still, deep down, I wanted to go—to spend time with some friends—probably for one last ride before I moved on to the next. I wanted to <em>seize my season</em>; wait, I didn’t even know why that was the theme.</p><p>All I knew was I did want a break from the monotony of sitting in front of my PC, endlessly coding and writing papers—to step back, breathe, reflect, and ask my God, “<em>Why? What now?</em>”</p><p>It took me a month to finally sign up. It’s hard to start something new when you don’t know why you’re starting it (<em>even writing this article took me two months</em>). Without a clear reason, it’s easy to freeze.</p><p>Someone close to me suggested fundraising. But honestly, I couldn’t. It felt low to ask for other people’s hard-earned money—or at least that’s what I told myself. In truth, I was just too prideful to ask.</p><p>Eventually, awkwardly but with permission from elders, I fundraised and asked a few friends from my church. I assumed I wouldn’t raise enough and would have to cover the rest. To my surprise, people came up to me—without me even asking—and offered support. In less than two weeks, I had exactly what I needed to join the conference.</p><h2 id=hello-korea>Hello, Korea</h2><p>Six years ago, in 2019, on a 6-hour layover, I stood in the long, wide halls of Incheon Airport, gazing toward the expanse of the runways. I thought to myself, “<em>sana makabalik at makapasyal.</em>” (“I hope I can go back and visit”; I had to include it because Tagalog just sounds better).</p><p>This time, walking through the streets, everything felt strangely familiar—the sights, the sounds, even the rhythm of the people. I’ve seen them somewhere before: the tall apartment buildings, the food bursting with color, the streets draped in Hangul, the grandmas stretching and walking early in the morning to their hearts’ content. I really had seen them, not in a past life, but in K-dramas.</p><p>Yet while familiar, everything still felt foreign. It wasn’t the place, it was the experience itself. It was the complete opposite of chasing my dream, where every step had to be fought for; this one was simply given; I had done nothing to earn it.</p><p>The day before the conference, I felt an urge to break from my usual Bible reading plan and revisit a passage I hadn’t quite understood. Though I was already several chapters ahead, I turned back to Genesis 15. It was about a man who couldn’t believe he was being promised something so great: I saw myself in a similar position to that man.</p><p>The next day, in the first session, the speaker claimed, “<em>everyone who is here was brought here by God</em>”. I didn’t know how to process that. I did believe that everything happening happens under the permission of God, but I was slightly guilty since I was there because part of me simply wanted to escape my daily rhythm. That was, until he revealed that his message was going to be about the very same chapter I read the day before. “<em>I was meant to be here to learn something,</em>” I thought.</p><p>The speaker continued to share about that chapter: the topic of God’s Promise and how it relates to current society and how people think: how our hearts find things to chase and at times we are left in pain. That was an arrow pointed at me. I realized what I had to learn, and I couldn’t stop my tears from streaming down my eyes.</p><p>Because I remembered the “<em>why???</em>” I used to ask.</p><h2 id=why>&ldquo;<em>Why???</em>&rdquo;</h2><blockquote><p>“Why would You let me pass but not give me the means?
Didn’t I ask You to not let me pass at all if I wasn’t meant to be there?</p></blockquote><p>The emotions I bottled all those months kept spilling out. How dare I.. The speech came to an end and everyone had time for prayer and singing. I couldn’t stand up, my knees were planted to the ground. To make things worse, along with my tears came a drizzle, watering the ground. In a sea of 10,000 people, I was drowning in my own sea of tears.</p><p>In the depths of that sea, I craved for hope. I wanted someone to help me out of a pit I dug myself in.</p><p>There’s an English saying: “Your god is too small.” At least, when it came to my career, my god was indeed small. Coming from a middle-income family, money was never something I had. So my “god” became <em>achievement</em>. I always had a reason to start things—I worked, worked, and worked, convinced there was meaning behind everything I did. And&mldr; it got me nowhere.</p><p>With my confidence crushed, even that god has shrunk. It’s become far too small to carry me now—so small that I couldn’t even imagine continuing my studies here in Japan.</p><h2 id=what-now>What now?</h2><p>I was reminded of a blue and yellow card on our kitchen wall back home— one that pushed me through countless 5:00 a.m. mornings in high school. It carried a quote:</p><blockquote><p>Expect great things from God, attempt great things for God.
— <cite>William Carey<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></cite></p></blockquote><p>I used to think the weight was on “attempt,” but the order begins with expectation—with hope.</p><p>At the conference, I met people who lived out that hope: some opening schools for underprivileged children in Africa, others praying faithfully for an end to the Korean War. Their lives are driven by trust; that their work won’t be in vain—a hope to continute building toward a <em>Promised Neverland</em> of peace.</p><p>That same hope echoes from the God of Genesis. A life that still holds meaning even in failure and disappointment, a life shaped toward the best. A world where tears are no more. Even when I fail, the promise remains. That was the hope I had forgotten.</p><blockquote><p><em>But how can I know what You’re promising me is true?</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Right here, right now. I will sign this agreement for both of us. If this agreement isn’t kept, I Myself will bear the consequences.</p></blockquote><p>The last session ended with a question: “<em>What are you willing to expect from God?</em>” When I closed my eyes, what surfaced wasn’t a grand calling but a small, steady voice: “<em>I want to keep learning.</em>” I thought I had already lost the right to dream that simply.</p><p>Yet somewhere in the grief of these past months, I realized something: my hope was never meant to rest on fighting for the “best version” of myself or securing a bright future. I will fail—by mistake, by circumstance.</p><p><em>To seize my season isn’t to control it; I can’t. It is to trust the One who does</em>. That was the lesson I knew in my head but had to relearn in my heart. And that’s how an eventful week in Korea ends: I was meant to be there to have my hope rekindled—not in myself, but in the love that stays beyond situation.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>The above quote is excerpted from ___.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></section><footer class=article-footer></footer></article><footer class=site-footer><section class=copyright>&copy;
