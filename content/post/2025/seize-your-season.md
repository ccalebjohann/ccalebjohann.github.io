Have you ever been in a season when nothing seems to go according to plan, when every effort suddenly feels uncertain? When the dream you’ve worked so hard for is right in front of you, yet somehow still out of reach?

# The next race?

As I neared the end of my undergraduate studies, I began to feel the weight of deciding “the next move.” If you know me personally or have read my previous nUance article, you’d probably know that I’ve been working toward becoming a motorsport engineer. That dream shaped my years here in Nagoya—pulling myself through meetings, language barriers, and endless late nights. I prayed, put in the effort, and shot my shot at my dream university in the UK. All that was left was to wait for the start of my next race, wherever that may be.

I just wanted a clearer vision on how I will be moving on after I graduate, so when I finally got my admission results, it felt like a huge burden was taken off my back. I couldn’t believe it —I passed! I was overjoyed, thinking all those years of effort had finally paid off. My mind was eager to play through the memories of tomorrow.

Or so I wished... I couldn’t fund myself.

I didn’t get the scholarship. I didn’t have even 5% of the money to support just 1 year of studies. I wasn’t even eligible for a loan because of my nationality. I tried to find sponsors, hoping anyone would be willing to support a young Filipino guy onto the technical side of motorsport. It was final: I couldn’t go. The light didn’t turn green. I found myself bawling my eyes out as I stared at the screen right in front of me.

As I pressed that button. I grieved a future that might never be. It was painful as burying your favorite cat—it stung, but you had to see it to the end. All I had in mind was “Why???”

I told myself I had a plan: to go home. I was late for job hunting, so at least for the near future, I buried my dreams of working in R&D in the automotive industry. I jokingly told my friends, “I’m going home” thinking that was the end of the road.

# One last ride: why not?

Back in March, I got invited to a Christian summer conference in Korea. The theme was “Seize your Season”, something I thought was so timely. 

There were many reasons for me not to go: I had to finish my research, and I’d likely have to pay out of pocket. Still, deep down, I wanted to go—to spend time with some friends—probably for one last ride before I moved on to the next. I wanted to seize my season; wait, I didn’t even know why that was the theme.

All I knew was I did want a break from the monotony of sitting in front of my PC, endlessly coding and writing papers—to step back, breathe, reflect, and ask my God, “Why? What now?”

It took me a month to finally sign up. It’s hard to start something new when you don’t know why you’re starting it (even writing this article took me two months). Without a clear reason, it’s easy to freeze.

Someone close to me suggested fundraising. But honestly, I couldn’t. It felt low to ask for other people’s hard-earned money—or at least that’s what I told myself. In truth, I was just too prideful to ask.

Eventually, awkwardly but with permission from elders, I fundraised and asked a few friends from my church. I assumed I wouldn’t raise enough and would have to cover the rest. To my surprise, people came up to me—without me even asking—and offered support. In less than two weeks, I had exactly what I needed to join the conference.

# Hello, Korea

Six years ago, in 2019, on a 6-hour layover, I stood in the long, wide halls of Incheon Airport, gazing toward the expanse of the runways. I thought to myself, “sana makabalik at makapasyal.” (“I hope I can go back and visit”; I had to include it because Tagalog just sounds better).

This time, walking through the streets, everything felt strangely familiar—the sights, the sounds, even the rhythm of the people. I’ve seen them somewhere before: the tall apartment buildings, the food bursting with color, the streets draped in Hangul, the grandmas stretching and walking early in the morning to their hearts’ content. I really had seen them, not in a past life, but in K-dramas.

Yet while familiar, everything still felt foreign. It wasn’t the place, it was the experience itself. It was the complete opposite of chasing my dream, where every step had to be fought for; this one was simply given; I had done nothing to earn it. 

The day before the conference, I felt an urge to break from my usual Bible reading plan and revisit a passage I hadn’t quite understood. Though I was already several chapters ahead, I turned back to Genesis 15. It was about a man who couldn’t believe he was being promised something so great: I saw myself in a similar position to that man.

The next day, in the first session, the speaker claimed, “everyone who is here was brought here by God”. I didn’t know how to process that. I did believe that everything happening happens under the permission of God, but I was slightly guilty since I was there because part of me simply wanted to escape my daily rhythm.
That was, until he revealed that his
message was going to be about the
very same chapter I read the day
before.
“I was meant to be here to
learn something,

” I thought.

The speaker continued to share
about that chapter: the topic of God’s
Promise and how it relates to current
